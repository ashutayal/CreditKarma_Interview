# CreditKarma_Interview
Code for Credit Karma technical interview - Analyst Intern

Partner Operations Intern Technical Case Study


Situation: We need to create a structured and standardized view for data values that are found in a variety of places. For example, data values may be on a public web page, a private web page, or attached via email in an excel spreadsheet - let’s call these “data sources”. I would like to combine the data values into one standard spreadsheet and view them together. In this situation, we are interested in viewing the data values of a Discover credit card offer that appear on multiple different websites and spreadsheets in one place to make sure the offer details are all the same wherever they are displayed. An example of a data source is the Credit Karma offer page for the Discover it secured card (Data source 1). An example of a data value name is “Annual Fee” and the associated data value here is “$0”.


Task: Please automate the task of transferring data from these 3 linked data sources into a google doc or excel spreadsheet. All these data sources contain the same data values just in different locations and with different data value names. For example, “Annual Fee” in data source 1 and 2 but in data source 3 it is “CurrentPriceDescription.”  


Deliverable: A matrix of in a google doc or excel spreadsheet that pulls in at least 4 data values from these 3 data sources. You can either demonstrate the automation of this activity within the interview or walk through the steps you would take to perform this task. Here is an example of the matrix you may create:
